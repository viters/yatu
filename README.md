# YATU: Yet Another \(Performance\) Test Utility

**Yatu** is a tool that allows to conduct performance tests for given path of methods inside any application. 
It provides a simple interface to define time measurement points. 
With **Yatu** you can test synchronous and asynchronous methods, mock any class within testing path and also prepare your testing 
environment. The goal of running tests with **Yatu** is to observe how long it takes to run a single method including \(or excluding\) any methods that are called on the fly.
